      <h1><a href=#the-red-banner>The Red Banner</a></h1>
      <p class='stanza'>
        Hands raised to brows,<br />
        throating lukewarm ally oaths,<br />
        singing its anthem,<br />
        squinting at the spring leaf<br />
        in July's sun.
      </p>
      <p class='stanza'>
        It flapped bright new green<br />
        whimmed by the winds,<br />
        finally fading a rich hue,<br />
        weighted in tradition.<br />
        Proud, it served<br />
        what it hung for,<br />
        from its high hoist<br />
        up on the tree.<br />
        But then,<br />
        what was that, a blush?<br />
        Shame perhaps, for sins<br />
        in its nascency?<br />
        Never! Far be it!<br />
        Green as ever.
      </p>
      <p class='stanza'>
        Don't you see the reddening<br />
        of the leaf hoisted high?<br />
        All crimson drenched<br />
        fliers will spatter the ground,<br />
        turn brown and be crushed to dirt.

      <p class='stanza'>
        a walking man surely knows <br />
        the strength of wind <br />
        whether at his back <br />
        or going in

      <h1><a href=#a-sonnet-about-the-internet>A Sonnet About The Internet</a></h1>
      <p class='stanza'>
        As Adam from blest first fell forth the sweeping internet, <br />
        A race to match man’s corruption ensued upon the switch, <br />
        Yet still I share fate’s perspective, a dream is dreamt in which, <br />
        Our toes in waters deep’ning, we’ve barely begun to wet.
      </p>
      <p class='stanza'>
        Thus far, we’ve seen it displace some sluggards where they were set, <br />
        Forge harm upon our common rooms, (with fur and whisker kitsch) <br />
        Oh, some have tried to tame its lust, and some have gotten rich, <br />
        But like the Mountain of the House, we’ve seen near naught as yet.
      </p>
      <p class='stanza'>
        While gardens of the age still grow, to whittle down our hours, <br />
        To fit the pantheon into pocket and pocketbook, <br />
        The Master’s web has Gospel in it’s wire and protocol. <br />
        While market ad and market fist comprise the earthly pow’rs, <br />
        And platforms breathe a single tongue like Satan’s tallest rook, <br />
        Fails not my wond’ring at the thought, “My God redeems it all!”
